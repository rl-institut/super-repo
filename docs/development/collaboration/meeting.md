# Meeting

In order to develop a program collaboratively, it is helpful to regularly
exchange information about the current status and to discuss open questions
and make decisions.

# Developer Meetings

In the regular developer meetings, the open issues and pull requests are
discussed and the next release is planned. There should also be time for
the general vision of software development.

The regular developer meeting `super-repo-dev` takes place on the
**first Wednesday of the month between 9 and 9:30 am**. <br>
The meeting room is: https://meet.jit.si/super-repo-dev

# User Meetings

The user meeting is specifically designed for users of the software to ask
questions about usage, make requests for new functionality,
or give general feedback.

The regular user meeting takes place after the developer meeting in the same
room on the **first Wednesday of the month between 9:30 and 10 am**.
