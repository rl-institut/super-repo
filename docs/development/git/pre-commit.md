# Pre-commit

It is a tool to easily setup and run `pre-commit hooks` for your git repository.
See the documentation of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for further information.
It is used to improve auto-format code, do linting and run tests before every commit.

## Install

Install the required package in a python environment. <br>
ðŸ’» `pip install pre-commit` install pre-commit <br>
ðŸ’» `pre-commit install` install pre-commit

## Setup

The hooks are configured in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

## Run

All commits will trigger the hooks automatically.
ðŸ’  `git commit file` to commit

If you don't want to run the hooks you can use
ðŸ’  `git commit --no-verify file` to commit without hooks

!!! Note
There can be problems with file line endings on Windows, CRLF is used on Windows and LF is used on Linux.
LF is also maintained on platforms like GitHub.

To run the hooks on all files in your repository use:
ðŸ’» `pre-commit run --all-files`
